# ArcadeGame
## Description
  This is a game featuring Object oriented programming in JS. The goal of the game is to score the highest by moving the player up until it reaches any part of the sky(the blue section). The player faces enemies in the way and when it crashes with any of them, it decreases one life. The game is over when player loses all his three lives. There is a green gem randomly placed in the canvas that increases the score if the player touches it.
## Dependencies
  The game has three JS files. Engine.js gives the game its functionality drawing the canvas over and over while rendering methods on the player and enemy objects. Resources.js helps loading images easier. Apps.js has the class objects the game needs and instantiates those objects.
The game also depends on an image folder and a css folder where the styles are.
